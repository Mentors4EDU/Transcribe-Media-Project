#What we did
During this project we have build a MPEG-4 econding and streaming SDK for developers in Node.JS and PHP. We set up a server as well,
and worked on some Cryptography. For the Cyrptography we created many different Pass Key templates including ones in Cisco Type 5, Cisco
Type 7, and hash that follows AES standards. This SDK is meant to help developers encode and stream MPEG-4 files through their site in a
secure and intuitive way. We have used the MPEG Dash Protocol for this project as well as integrating Fluent's FFMPEG API.
