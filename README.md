#What we did
During this project we have built a MPEG-4 econding and streaming SDK for developers in Node.JS and PHP. We set up a server as well,
and worked on some Cryptography. For the Cyrptography we created many different Pass Key templates including ones in Cisco Type 5, Cisco
Type 7, and hash that follows AES standards. This SDK is meant to help developers encode and stream MPEG-4 files through their site in a
secure and intuitive way. We have used the MPEG Dash Protocol for this project as well as integrating Fluent's FFMPEG API. 

#Technology we Utilized
Besides utilizing Dash Viewer's protocols and integrating Fluent's API, we created an access key for CodeIgniter's framework to be used in securing the application in PHP. We utilized both Cisco type 5 and type 7 encryption keys as well as played around with IBM's encryption methods. We created RSA keys as well as messed with Diceware, which is a recent encryption technique. The primary programming languages involved in this project was Javascript and PHP. For the security end we did utilize VIM, ProLog, Unix commands, and some Python. 

#Some Problems we Ran Into
We did run into errors in our code that took time to fix. Converting Cisco Type 5 to Cisco Type 7 encryption was also something we struggled with. We had a problem trying to run Ubuntu Linux on a virtual server so had to utilize deploying the code in a digital ocean server. We did have problems trying to create a Joomla page so we hosted our project on GitHub instead using a template. Most of our focus was built on getting the demo to work and making sure we have a secure SDK for developers to use. Another problem we ran into was getting the GitHub to sync in the desktop in order to move or transfer folders. We eventually got it to work using Git Shell and some help from the tech mentors/coaches.
